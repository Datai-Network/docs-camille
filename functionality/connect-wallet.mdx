Receiving personalized recommendations on your liquidity positions requires connecting your wallet. Once connected Camille will gain an overview of your liquidity positions and provide you with personalized recommendations.

Camille will not only scan your positions and give position recommendations but also provide you with insights and reasoning as to why she did so. This will help you understand the market better and make more informed decisions.
