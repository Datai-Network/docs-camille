Camille is designed to provide you with the most relevant information and recommendations based on your input. Here are some best practices for creating prompts and making sure you're getting the data you need.

## Use natural language

She understands natural language, so you don't need to use specific commands or keywords. Just ask her questions as you would a human.

## Be specific

The more context you give her, the more meaningful her responses will be. For example, if you're looking for the best pools on PancakeSwap, you could ask:

```
Recommend pools with the most stable ROI over the past 30 days on PancakeSwap on BSC network.
```

## Ask follow-up questions

If you're not sure about something, ask for clarification. Camille is here to help you understand the market better, so don't hesitate to ask for more information.

## Rephrase your questions

If you're not getting the information you need, try rephrasing your question. Sometimes a small change in wording can make a big difference in the response you get.

As with any AI, the more you interact with Camille, the better she'll understand your needs and preferences. So don't be afraid to experiment and see what works best for you.
