Camille simplifies DeFi by automatically detecting and analyzing a userâ€™s positions across multiple DEXs and chains. Powered by Datai Network, she leverages real-time & historical on-chain data to make AI-driven personalized recommendations. Whether you prefer lower-risk, steady-growth approaches or short-term gains capturing market trends, she is continually learning from sentiment, media narratives, and performance analytics from on-chain data.

Her vision is to empower every user with data-driven insights and actionable suggestions, providing a seamless, iterative experience that transforms the way DeFi portfolios are managed. As Camille progresses in the future and can trade on your behalf (within the limits you set), she will receive a cut from the profits she generates for you, which she then uses to buy back her own tokens, and provide more rewards to her loyal users.
