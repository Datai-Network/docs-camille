## Early Adopter Rewards

Embark on your journey with exclusive rewards designed to honor your early contributions. The sooner you provide liquidity, the greater your share of the rewards pool—our way of celebrating the pioneers who helped lay the foundation of our ecosystem.

### Liquidity Provider Airdrops

Early liquidity providers receive special token airdrops as a thank-you for their critical role in kickstarting our decentralized exchange. Each airdrop is a recognition of your commitment and a stepping stone toward building a robust community.

### Wallet Connection Bonuses

Connect your wallet within the first two weeks after the Token Generation Event (TGE) and unlock bonus tokens. These rewards not only enhance your token balance but also grant you access to Camille’s premium services, ensuring you experience the full potential of our platform.

## Engagement & Loyalty Programs

Our ecosystem rewards active participation. The more you engage with Camille and contribute to our community, the more opportunities you have to grow your stake and earn additional rewards.

### Referral & Community Rewards

Invite your friends and peers to join the community and reap the benefits of our referral program. Additionally, your valuable input—whether through feedback, bug reports, or social media sharing—will be recognized with extra token incentives that further boost your engagement.

### Milestone & Loyalty Bonuses

We celebrate your long-term commitment with special milestone bonuses. As you reach key engagement thresholds, enjoy exclusive rewards that acknowledge your dedication and help solidify your position in our growing ecosystem.

## Gamification & Community Incentives

Experience a more dynamic and interactive environment with our gamification features. These incentives are designed to make your participation both fun and rewarding, driving friendly competition and community spirit.

### Leaderboards & NFT Badges

Climb the leaderboards and earn your place among top contributors. Collect unique NFT badges that serve as digital trophies for your achievements—because every contribution deserves recognition, whether you're a casual participant or a seasoned digital whale.
