## Tokenomics & Distribution

Our token distribution strategy is designed to accelerate Camille’s growth, empower active community participation, and reward long-term commitment—all while enabling premium access to our advanced DeFi insights.

### Bonding Curve Sale (50%)

Leveraging a dynamic pricing model through a bonding curve (on creator bid), this sale ensures fair market pricing at launch while stimulating early adoption and driving robust market dynamics.

### DEX Liquidity Provision (20%)

Allocated to strengthen decentralized exchange liquidity on PancakeSwap, these tokens support a stable trading environment—facilitating smooth transactions and continuous market activity.

### Community Incentives & Airdrops (10%)

Designed to reward early adopters and active community members, this allocation is gradually released over a 6-month period. The strategy fosters organic growth and ongoing engagement across the ecosystem.

### Staking & LP Rewards (10%)

Tokens dedicated to staking and liquidity provision empower users to unlock premium features. Distributed over 6 months, this allocation encourages lasting commitment and rewards users for their support.

### Team Allocation (10%)

Committed to Camille’s long-term success, the team’s share is subject to a 1-month cliff followed by a 6-month vesting period. This approach ensures alignment with the project’s future and sustainable growth.
